# BioVenomSdk
Description
BioVenomSdk is an innovative solution designed to transform user engagement with the Venom Network. This SDK leverages the native account abstraction support of Venom Blockchain and can be seamlessly integrated into any web-based DApp.

The solution mitigates the risks faced by users of traditional browser wallets by storing keys securely within the secure enclave of mobile devices, thereby eliminating the need for a seed phrase.

With this SDK, we can bring together the strengths of both browser wallets and hardware wallets, while effectively mitigating their respective weaknesses. The private key never leaves the device, and is therefore never exposed, guaranteeing a level of security comparable to that of hardware wallets, all while ensuring a smooth and effortless onboarding experience for users.
